** Binary Insertion Sort **

Binary insertion sort is a sorting algorithm which is similar to the insertion sort, but instead of using linear search to find the location where an element should be inserted, we use binary search. Thus, we reduce the comparative value of inserting a single element from O (N) to O (log N).
